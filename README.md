#### Course Description:
This course explores the fundamentals of storytelling through sequential image making. The focus is to introduce students to a variety of animation techniques, vocabulary, tools and history. Students will create three potential portfolio pieces while learning the basics of Stop Motion, Adobe Photoshop, Premiere and After Effects— to create, digitize and animate artwork. 

#### Course Requirements:
Students are expected to participate in class: contributing to class discussions, giving other students constructive feed back, arriving on time having thoughtfully completed the reading, technical and creative assignments. Computers and mobile devices must be silenced and not glowing during critique, in class screenings, technical demonstrations, class discussion and student presentations.

It is your responsibility to turn in work on time, to make up any missed assignments, and to catch up with the class in the event of an absence. Late work is unacceptable; however, this work can be turned in for partial credit. If you know you are going to be absent, contact the professor by email in advance.

Students will be required to do research on one animation studio of their choosing. In week 10, they will present their findings to the class. Students can present their research in any way they choose but must give a 7 minute oral presentation complete with slide deck.

You are required to maintain a blog for this class. This is where you will post your homework assignments to then link to our class wiki. Think of it like a digital sketchbook - the blog is not meant to be a finished portfolio site, but a place for your creative process and works in progress.

Drawing skills are not necessary for this class, however, students are required to keep a sketchbook, and bring it to class every week. Each student should sketch, storyboard or write in their sketchbook daily. Students should bring an external storage device with them to class every week.

#### Materials:
* Class Blog
* Class Sketchbook
* External Storage Drive — Thumb/Jump or External Hard drive
* Lynda, Vimeo, Github & FreeSound Accounts

#### Mobile Devices:
Your device is required for the course. Make it a tool for you to use in this class, and not a device that directs your attention away from you and your classmates’ class time. It is okay if you do not have a mobile device.

#### Reading:
* Required:
 ** Understanding Comics - Scott McCloud
 ** Motion Graphics - Ian Crook and Peter Bear
* Suggested:
 ** The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation - Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson
 ** The Animator’s Survival Kit - Richard Williams

#### Assignments:
Every week students will be asked to read, watch and share a variety of media experiences as well as share the work they create during in class discussion and critique. Every week will be different. Please pay close attention to the syllabus online as these may change throughout the semester.

#### Blog:
Students will be asked to share images or videos as a means to turn in homework assignments. Students should set up and maintain a personal blog for this purpose. There are many free options that will offer you enough storage space for the semester. I suggest Wordpress or Medium but choose whatever platform you prefer.

#### “Share” (or the class Wiki):
To turn in your homework you must link to it every week on the class wiki. Wherever it 		says “share” - you are required to post on the wiki. To contribute to the wiki you must 		set up a Github account. We will do this in class on the first day.
